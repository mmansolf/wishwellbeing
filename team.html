His research focuses on measuring and understanding healthcare professional well-being through a systems lens. As founding leader of the Well-Being Influencers Survey for Healthcare (WISH) research consortium, he led the development of WISH, a validated tool designed to assess perceptions of organizational conditions that shape well-being rather than individual states like burnout. He also co-chairs the American Society of Anesthesiologists’ well-being research working group and serves as both a member and Change Maker Coach for the National Academy of Medicine’s Action Collaborative on Clinician Well-Being and Resilience."
