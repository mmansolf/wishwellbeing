             data-about="Dr. Higgins is Director of Health and Well-Being for UCLA’s Department of Anesthesiology and Perioperative Medicine and a Physician Health Officer for UCLA Health. His research focuses on measuring and understanding healthcare professional well-being through a systems lens. As founding leader of the Well-Being Influencers Survey for Healthcare (WISH) research consortium, he led the development of WISH, a validated tool designed to assess perceptions of organizational conditions that shape well-being rather than individual states like burnout. He also co-chairs the American Society of Anesthesiologists’ well-being research working group and serves as both a member and Change Maker Coach for the National Academy of Medicine’s Action Collaborative on Clinician Well-Being and Resilience."

I conducted all analyses to validate the Well-Being Influencers Survey for Healthcare (WISH) and designed the website you're looking at right now. My background is in psychometrics and missing data, including both methodological development and application in psychology and health research. My quantitative strengths and program of research are in psychometrics, mega-analysis, machine learning, missing data and measurement error, and data harmonization. As a team scientist, I routinely provide expertise on psychometrics and missing data to other researchers."

My research focuses on leveraging large complex data sources and advanced analytics like machine learning to understand and improve perioperative outcomes. One of my aims is to bring data-driven approaches to how we address healthcare professional well-being and burnout. It is essential that we have objective metrics to identify risk factors, regularly track baseline well-being metrics, and rigorously evaluate the impact of interventions. I serve on the American Society of Anesthesiologists Committee on Physician Well-Being, the Society of Pediatric Anesthesiology Well-Being Committee, and Well-Being Research Working Groups for both societies."
