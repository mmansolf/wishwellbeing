    <h1>Welcome to WISH</h1>
    WISH is a novel survey tool measuring workplace influencers of well-being in healthcare workers. By targeting influencers of well-being, we can get upstream of burnout and attrition, fostering sustainable and rewarding careers for healthcare workers.

    WISH was recently published in <i>Anesthesiology<\i>, here's a link to the validation paper: <a href="https://www.google.com">Measuring Well-Being Influencers: Development and Validation of the WISH Inventory</a>

    WISH measures the following influencers.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Psychological Safety</strong> (3 items): A workplace attribute where individuals feel safe to share ideas, ask questions, and admit mistakes without fear, fostered by leadership, teamwork, and mutual respect.</li>
      <li><strong>Perceived Social Support</strong> (5 items): Emotional and practical support from coworkers, proven to enhance job satisfaction and protect against burnout.</li>
      <li><strong>Leadership Support</strong> (3 items): Support from leaders who prioritize employee growth, ethical decision-making, and transparency, shown to directly improve well-being and engagement.</li>
      <li><strong>Work Meaning</strong> (5 items): Purpose and fulfillment supported by autonomy, skill growth, contributions to the greater good, and recognition, essential for engagement and professional satisfaction.</li>
      <li><strong>Inclusion and Belonging</strong> (4 items): Being valued as an individual while contributing meaningfully to the team, linked to creativity, commitment, and overall workplace well-being.</li>
      <li><strong>Justice</strong> (3 items): Occupational fairness where transparent policies, clear decision-making, and responsive leadership create trust and promote well-being.</li>
      <li><strong>Work Life Integration</strong> (3 items): “Balance” enabled from such aspects as flexible scheduling and predictable workloads that reduce work-life conflict, foster loyalty, reduce absenteeism, and mitigate burnout.</li>
