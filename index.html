        <p class="intro-text"><b>We are a consortium dedicated to advancing the science and practice of healthcare worker well-being improvement. </b>Our multiprofessional team develops rigorous measurement tools and evidence-based frameworks to drive meaningful, systems-level change. At the heart of our work is the belief that improving our systems can pave the way to more sustainable and more fulfilling careers in healthcare.</p>
        <p class="intro-text">The cornerstone of our efforts is the <b>Well-Being Influencers Survey for Healthcare (WISH)</b>—a validated survey tool that quantifies the complex construct of healthcare worker well-being through a systems lens. By assessing and highlighting the factors that shape workplace experience, we help clarify what meaningful well-being prioritization looks like—not just for clinicians, but for the long-term stability of healthcare organizations and the quality of patient care. <b></p>
