            <p>Developed in response to the growing consensus that meaningful well-being improvement for healthcare workers requires system-level change, the Well-Being Influencers Survey for Healthcare (WISH) is a novel, validated tool that assesses the organizational and cultural factors shaping healthcare worker well-being. Unlike traditional measures focused on individual well-being states (e.g., burnout), WISH shifts the focus to the occupational drivers of these outcomes—such as leadership support, working conditions, and psychological safety. By measuring the root-origin factors of well-being and burnout rather than their downstream effects, WISH fills a critical gap in well-being science and provides an actionable framework for system-level improvement. This manuscript details the development and validation of this high-demand tool and reinforces the central role of system-level factors in shaping healthcare professionals’ well-being. Validation data further demonstrate that WISH provides added value beyond established measures, capturing unique insights that can guide targeted, system-level interventions.</p>
